# Python PDF Bookmarker

For as long as I can remember, I've been frustrated that Mac's built in PDF viewer (Preview) doesn't support bookmarking PDF files. Sure, Adobe Acrobat Pro can do it, but who wants to pay hundreds of dollars for a personal license?

When I stumbled upon a Python package called [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/), I was intrigued to see that it had the ability to create bookmarks. After playing around with it, I realized that the solution to my PDF-bookmarking troubles was only a simple GUI away.
